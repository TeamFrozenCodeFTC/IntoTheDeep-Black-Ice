Black Ice is a **Reactive Path Follower** developed by __FTC Team #18535__, Frozen Code. It is designed to provide more efficient, effective, and high-speed path following by **predicting real-time, directional braking distance**. Unlike traditional path-following libraries that gradually slow the robot down, Black Ice dynamically calculates the optimal braking distance based on the robotâ€™s current speed. This allows the robot to maintain full power for as long as possible, only beginning to brake at the precise moment needed. By predicting the robot's position in real time, the robot can also navigate curved paths with greater precision, minimizing overshooting and staying on track.

Unique, key features:
- Zero Manual or Arbitrary Tuning
- Modular Customization
- Bezier Curves

Black Ice is tailored for teams with odometry wheels looking for simple, high-speed path execution with the option of modular customization.

# Usage
### Requirements: Odometry Wheels / Pinpoint Odometry Processor
Black Ice intentionally uses the the slippage of the wheels in order to stop faster. This requires separate dead wheels in order to not get off.

## Simple
Moving the robot to a point and stopping:
```
// Moves the robot 24 inches in the y direction
Movement.stopAtPosition(0, 24, 90);
```

## Why Did We Develop Black Ice?
- To intuitively learn, hands-on, how path following works in robotics. We encourage users to experiment by creating their own correction functions or adding new features.
- To explore more efficient and simpler solutions
- To minimize the tuning process and reduce complexity
- To have more modular customization

### We Encourage *You* to Make Your Own Movement System
We developed Black Ice to intuitively learn, hands-on, how path following works in robotics. We encourage users to do the same by experimenting with their own correction functions or adding new features. We designed Black Ice very modular in order to easily change the path-following algorithms.

Here are some ideas for new features:
- Try following paths using derivatives (functions that give you the slope of a curve at any point) of the bezier curves. This may have to be combined with a translational correction to stay on the path. This is what Pedro Path uses, however they do not incorporate braking distances.
- Implement a better target velocity algorithm.
- Implement feedforward system.

# How Does Black Ice Work?
By having the robot follow points, this forces the robot to follow the path. Using dervivates like pedro paths adds complexity and adds transitional correction.

Support for Bezier Curves

Black Ice is a efficient and effective dynamic path follower developed by Team #18535, Frozen Code, in the 2025 season and offseason.

How is ours is different from others like Roadrunner and Pedro Path? The key difference is that Black Ice calculates braking distance by having the motors on zero power brake mode. Other libraries, calculate drift distance by having the motors on zero power float mode. Our framework uses the braking distance to predict where the robot will be next, allowing it to maintain full speed until it reaches an optimal braking point, minimizing unnecessary slowing while ensuring precise stopping.

We have just one tuning test that runs the robot at different velocities to brake and calculate the braking distance. With those data points, we used quadratic regression (since stopping distance is proportional to velocity squared) to derive a function that accurately predicts the required braking distance at any speed.

Our drive power formula is purely proportional, subtracting the predicted braking distance from the target position. No arbitrary constants are needed. No integral term is needed, as stationary robots have zero braking distance. No derivative term is required either, since braking distance naturally adjusts to slow the robot precisely when needed.
