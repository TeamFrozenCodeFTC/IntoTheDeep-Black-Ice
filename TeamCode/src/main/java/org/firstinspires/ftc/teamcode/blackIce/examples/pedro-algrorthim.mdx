import PedroImplementation from "@/app/PedroImplementation";

Pedro path uses the Newton-Raphson method to find the closest point to the robot on the path.


What is a PIDF?
PIDF stand for Proportional (P), Integral (I), Derivative (D), and Feedforward (F).
Integral is avoided.

PIDFs aim to to convert a target and a current into motor powers.

There are too types of PIDFs. Positional PIDs and velocity PIDFs.

The Proportional in a velocity PIDF

Proportional is the main term that just multiplies by the difference between the target velocity and the current velocity.
For example if you want to go 50inches/s but you are only going 40inches/s, then that is a difference of 10 inches/s.
If you have a proportional constant of 0.05 then the proportional term would be 0.05 * 10 = 0.5 power.

The Feedforward term is constant that is multiplied by the target velocity. This can help the
 proportional if you already know how much power you need on average to reach a certain velocity.
 Because power to velocity is mostly linear, the feedforward is usually around 1/maxVelocity.
  This usually ends up being around 0.015.
  For example if your robot can go 60inches/s at full power, then if you want the robot to 30 inches/s
  you can expect to need 0.5 power to reach 30 inches/s.
  If we use the 1/maxVelocity of 1/60, then the feedforward would be 0.00167. This exactly matches up with: 30inches/s * 0.0167 = 0.5

For positional PIDs, the proportional behaves the same but instead of a target velocity it uses a
 target position.

For a vector PIDF it simply just applies it to each x and y component of the error.

There is three drive vectors for pedroPathing

- `driveVector`: A velocity PIDF (without Integral term) that is responsible for accelerating and
decelerating the robot along the path. The target velocity derived from kinematics formulas to
 decelerate the robot at a specified deceleration (inches/s^2). The direction of the drive vector is
  always tangent to the path. See __ for more details.

- `headingCorrection`: A simple heading PD controller that aims to maintain the robot's heading at a given target heading.
- `translational`: A positional PD controller that aims to keep the robot on the path.

## Using the Quickstart

The quickstart is the easiest way to install Pedro Pathing.

1. In Android Studio, go to `Main Menu -> File -> New -> Project from
Version Control`. For the URL, enter
`https://github.com/Pedro-Pathing/Quickstart.git`.
2. **OR** run `git clone https://github.com/Pedro-Pathing/Quickstart.git`.
Make sure you have [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed first.

## Manually

In your `build.dependencies.gradle`, add the following to the `repositories
{ }` block:

```groovy
maven { url = 'https://maven.pedropathing.com' }
```

Then, add the following to the `dependencies { }` block:

<PedroImplementation/>

Lastly, copy the files from the [`pedroPathing` package in the quickstart](https://github.com/Pedro-Pathing/Quickstart/tree/dev/TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode/pedroPathing)
into your code.
